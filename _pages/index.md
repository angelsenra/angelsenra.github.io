Hello! Thank you for being interested in my website.

At the moment (end of november), I'm in the process of moving the content of the old version to jekyll.
The css might also not be awesome yet, but it's going to get better!
Meanwhile, why don't you check out the [about me](/about-me) or the [blog](/blog)

And please check again in a couple of weeks. Much more info should be here. Cheers!


TODOs for the week starting 23 Nov:

- [x] Add blog tags
- [x] Add cv section with experience and awards/competitions and text about me work-wise. Work picture
    - [x] PDF download
        - [ ] UTF8 support
        - [ ] Update dependencies, load them later
    - [x] Improve button, link back to jobs page
- [ ] Make the about me less of a cv. Friendly picture
- [ ] Improve the home page, decide how to link to the other pages properly
- [x] Google Analytics in proper account
- [ ] SEO and page speed
    - [x] Enable sitemap Jekyll plugin
- [x] Blog comments (disquss)
- [x] Contact form
