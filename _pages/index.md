Hello! Thank you for being interested in my website.

There are multiple paths that you could take from here.
If you came from linkedin or are interested in **work-related opportunities**,
check out [the jobs page]({% link _pages/jobs.md %}) where you can also find [my resume]({% link _pages/cv.md %})

Or perhaps you just want to know **who I am**; if that\'s the case, head out to [the about-me section]({% link _pages/about-me.md %})

And if you want to **read my articles**, check [the blog]({% link _pages/blog.md %}).
You could start by reading [how this website came to be]({% link _posts/2020-11-29-migrated-to-jekyll.md %})
