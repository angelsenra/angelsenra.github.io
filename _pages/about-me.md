# About me

Hello!
My name is Angel. I'm a somewhat eclectic programmer.

I love working on new things and technologies I don't know. Routine kills me, but when a project becomes a challenge I can't stop working on it.
Being self-taught for so long has made me very quick to learn new things and handle myself well.
However, I love working as a team with people who bring value and different ideas and I'm not afraid of making decisions.

Although I usually do a lot of things at the same time I always have time to answer questions so don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything.
