About me
</h1>

My name is Angel. I'm a programmer currently living in Linz, Austria.

## My story

As my father works in informatics, I've always been interested in computers and I used to love playing with Windows XP when I was 6.
<br>
When I was 12 I started playing Minecraft and soon I discovered the Redstone. It allowed you to build simple electronic circuits. I built clocks, tic tac toes, gambling machines, [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)), and simple calculators that could add and subtract small numbers (~8 bits). At 13, I started making simple games using [Game Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker) which had a scripting language in which I wrote my first lines. I then moved into python with Pygame; for a few years, I copied many classic games (Pong, Tetris, Chess, Bomberman, Minesweeper, ...) improving at each iteration.
<br>
By the time I was 16 I had already opened my horizons to more than games, learning basic cryptography, GUI (Tkinter), simple AI like minimax, and more. In high school, I joined a programming club and started solving problems in [projecteuler.net](https://github.com/angelsenra/euler) and [r/dailyprogrammer](https://github.com/angelsenra/dailyprogrammer).
<br>
When I was 17 I won [HP Codewars Madrid](https://github.com/angelsenra/hpcodewars-madrid-2018) with a colleague from the programming club. At this moment I realized that what was for many years just a hobby, would be my career.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy coding while listening to music and podcasts; reading; watching youtube; playing chess; doing the Rubik's cube; and, only recently, juggling. I'm into eating healthy and exercising. I love swimming and the beach. In the city, I like to play billiards and tennis (or [padel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padel_(sport)) if it's possible) as well as going for a bite with friends
